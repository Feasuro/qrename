# QRename
Batch file renaming gui application.
## Installation instructions.
### Arch linux and other distros using pacman:
1. Download [PKGBUILD](https://github.com/Feasuro/qrename/blob/main/PKGBUILD) file
2. Run `makepkg -srci` from the directory where you downloaded PKGBUILD
### Other systems:
Download the application code and install it with pip.
```
git clone https://github.com/Feasuro/qrename.git
cd qrename
pip install .
```
Not tested for anything other than linux, but should work on any UNIX and possibly on Windows. Let me know if it's different.
